DAAZ — Strategic Positioning Document

Last Updated: January 2026 Document Type: Brand Strategy & Positioning Status: Final

Executive Summary

DAAZ is a product consultancy led by senior product leadership. We work with companies to bring clarity to product decisions across product creation, growth, and change.

We operate at the intersection of strategic thinking and practical execution, serving as decision partners — not execution vendors — to founders, C-level executives, and product leaders navigating complexity, uncertainty, and transformation.

1. Company Overview

Name & Identity

Legal Name: DAAZ Digital LTDA (Brazil) / DAAZ (public-facing) Brand Name: DAAZ Tagline: Product Strategy & Leadership Category: Product Consultancy

Positioning Statement

DAAZ is a product consultancy led by senior product leadership. We help companies make better product decisions across product creation, growth, and change — especially in moments of uncertainty and transformation.

Geographic Scope

Primary Markets: United States, Europe

Operating Model: Global, remote, contractor-based

Legal Structure: B2B contracting (no visa sponsorship required)

2. What We Do

DAAZ provides three flagship services, each designed to address distinct moments of product complexity:

2.1 Fractional Product Leadership

What it is: We act as Head of Product or Principal Product Leader on a part-time basis, embedded within the company to provide hands-on leadership, strategic direction, and decision-making authority.

When it makes sense:

Companies that have grown without strong product leadership

Founders overloaded with tactical product decisions

Organizations facing misalignment between business, product, and technology

Critical phases of scale, transformation, or AI integration

What we deliver:

Product vision and strategy

Outcome-driven roadmaps

Product organization design (roles, rituals, metrics)

Strategic decision-making and trade-offs

Alignment across product, engineering, design, data, and business

Direct partnership with founders and C-level executives

Format:

Part-time engagement (2–3 days per week)

Medium-term contracts (3–6 months)

B2B contractor model

Remote and global

Pricing: USD 8,000–18,000 per month (depending on scope and intensity)

2.2 Product Discovery Sprint

What it is: A focused, intensive engagement designed to transform uncertainty into clear, actionable product decisions. This is not research for the sake of research — it's discovery oriented toward executive decision-making.

When it makes sense:

Product stagnation or low traction

Roadmap driven by opinion or internal pressure

High-stakes bets that cannot afford to fail

AI or new initiatives being discussed without clarity of value

What we deliver:

Clearly framed problems and opportunities

Validated (or invalidated) hypotheses

Objective success criteria

Definition of MVP, next bets, or kill decisions

Solid foundation for roadmap and execution

Format:

4–6 weeks

Fixed scope, fixed price

Direct participation from key stakeholders

Ends with executive-level decisions

Pricing: USD 10,000–25,000 per project

2.3 AI Product Co-Creation

What it is: A strategic engagement focused on conceiving and evolving AI-driven products, features, or agents that deliver real customer value — not isolated experiments or technology hype.

When it makes sense:

Companies want to apply AI but lack clarity on where it generates value

AI pilots exist but fail to achieve adoption or ROI

Desire to create user-centered AI agents or automations

AI is seen as a strategic product differentiator, not just technology

What we deliver:

AI use cases defined from real customer problems

User-centered workflows and experiences

Strategic decisions on when AI should automate vs. augment human work

Co-created product or agent vision and design

Implementation support (without becoming a development shop)

Format:

6–10 weeks (or integrated with Fractional Leadership)

Co-creation with product, engineering, and leadership

Project-based or ongoing engagement

Pricing: USD 18,000–50,000+ per project

What We Are

DAAZ is:

Senior product leadership — decision-makers, not executors

Strategic partners — embedded in complexity, not external advisors

Clarity providers — we bring structure to uncertainty

Decision-oriented — we help teams decide, not just explore

Pragmatic about AI — we focus on real value, not hype

What We Are Not

DAAZ is not:

A digital agency

A dev shop or software factory

A generic consultancy

A "solutions provider"

A marketing or growth agency

A vendor selling hours or headcount

4. Strategic Differentiators

4.1 Senior Leadership, Not Execution Capacity

We operate at the decision layer — where product strategy meets real-world constraints. We are not here to execute tasks; we are here to lead through complexity.

4.2 Embedded, Not External

We work inside the organization, aligned with teams and leadership, not as outside advisors delivering reports. Our work creates real change, not just recommendations.

4.3 Outcomes Over Deliverables

Success is measured by better decisions, clearer direction, and real business impact — not by the volume of documents or hours logged.

4.4 AI with Discipline

In a market saturated with AI hype, we bring a disciplined, user-centered approach. We co-create AI products that solve real problems and deliver measurable value — not demos that impress but don't scale.

4.5 International by Design

DAAZ operates globally, with no geographic friction. We are structured for cross-border B2B contracting, reducing legal and procurement complexity for international clients.

5. Brand Voice & Communication Principles

Tone of Voice

DAAZ communicates as someone who:

Has seen products fail and knows why

Asks difficult questions before making promises

Values clarity over enthusiasm

Speaks to decision-makers, not evangelists

7. Go-to-Market Strategy

Positioning in Sales Conversations

DAAZ enters conversations as:

A strategic hire, not a vendor

A decision partner, not an execution team

A risk reducer, not a cost center

Pricing Philosophy

Pricing signals seniority and outcome focus:

Never compete on price with agencies or dev shops

Always position as investment in better decisions

Anchor against full-time executive hires (fractional model)

Fixed-price projects preferred over hourly billing

Ideal Client Profile

Best-fit clients:

Recognize that product decisions are their biggest risk

Value strategic thinking over task execution

Are in moments of uncertainty, growth, or transformation

Have budget authority and decision-making power

Poor-fit clients:

Looking for "cheap execution"

Want large teams to scale delivery

Treat consultants as vendors, not partners

Don't value senior product expertise

8. Competitive Landscape

Who We Compete With (and How We Differentiate)

Competitor Type

How We Differ

Digital Agencies

We lead strategy and decisions, not deliver campaigns or websites

Dev Shops

We bring product leadership, not development capacity

Generic Consultancies

We are product-specialized and embedded, not generalist advisors

Freelance Product Consultants

We operate as a firm with structure, process, and proven frameworks

AI Consultancies

We focus on real customer value and adoption, not technology hype

9. Strategic Pillars

Pillar 1: Clarity in Complexity

We thrive in environments where decisions are hard, stakes are high, and clarity is scarce. We bring structure to ambiguity.

Pillar 2: Leadership, Not Labor

We sell decision-making capacity and strategic thinking — not hours, headcount, or task execution.

Pillar 3: Real AI Impact

We reject AI hype and focus on building AI products and agents that deliver measurable customer value and business outcomes.

Pillar 4: Global, Frictionless Engagement

We are designed for international work — contractor-based, remote-first, with no visa or legal complexity.

10. Success Metrics

DAAZ measures success by:

Client outcomes: Better product decisions, faster alignment, measurable impact

Repeat engagements: Clients returning for additional work or extending contracts

Strategic positioning: Being seen as senior product leadership, not execution vendors

Revenue quality: High-value, outcome-based contracts (not volume-based)

11. Internal Principles

Decision-Making Framework

When considering opportunities, ask:

Does this reinforce our positioning as senior product leadership?

Does this client value decisions over deliverables?

Can we deliver real impact, or is this theater?

Does this move us toward or away from our ideal client profile?

What We Say No To

Execution-only projects

Low-value, high-volume work

Clients treating us as vendors

Projects misaligned with our expertise

Engagements that dilute our positioning

What We Say Yes To

Strategic, high-stakes product decisions

Clients in transformation or growth

Opportunities to lead, not just advise

Engagements where we can create real change

12. Long-Term Vision

DAAZ aims to be recognized globally as:

The go-to partner for senior product leadership in complex environments

A strategic product consultancy known for clarity, rigor, and real impact

A trusted name in AI product co-creation — disciplined, user-centered, and value-driven

We are not building a large agency. We are building a reputation-driven, high-impact consultancy led by senior expertise.
